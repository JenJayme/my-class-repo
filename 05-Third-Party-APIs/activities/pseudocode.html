//Create a function that, when you enter an array, detects for duplicates with another array. If there are duplicates, return True.  Otherwise return False.

//Are the input arrays expected to be the same type, or mixed types? Or are they all expected to be integers as in the example?

//Variables needed include:
var input;
var isDup;
var controlArray = []

//Functions needed for major tasks:
//compare each item in the input array to the control array.  We'll need a for-loop to iterate through each item and compare it.  
//The loop can stop once a duplicate is identified.
