        <p>Ben Harper is an American singer-songwriter from Southern California who plays an eclectic mix of blues, folk, soul, reggae and rock. He's best known for his guitar-playing skills, unique vocals, memorable live performances, and activism.  I like him for his soulful ballads, bluesy riffs and social justice messages.</p>
        <blockquote style="color:wheat;"><em>"Harper’s music defies easy categorization because of its diverse sources: the Carter family, Woody Guthrie, Jimi Hendrix, and a melting pot of acoustic blues, reggae, country, hip-hop, rock, and classical styles.”</em> -Ben Elder, Acoustic Guitar Magazine </blockquote>

        <h2>Social Activism</H2>
        <p>Many of Harper’s songs express a moral urgency and passionate racial and socioeconomic consciousness, and his appearances frequently benefit marginalized or disadvantaged people.  Harper’s musical style and strong social conscience are reflective of his ethnic background, sharing African-American and Cherokee ancestry from his father, and Russian-Lithuanian Jewish roots from his mother.   
            Expressing his apprehension about America’s spiritual direction, Harper has said “Everything is so out of control, I want our mothers to be able to walk the streets and be safe. Instead of learning from history, whether it’s slavery or the Holocaust, we’re allowing history to repeat itself.”  
            </p>

Only when all of us can stop thinking in those terms and think instead of ourselves as a human species will we make the next step in our evolution."</strong></em></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <P><strong>Benjamin Chase Harper</strong> was born October 28, 1969 in Pomona, California, just outside Los Angeles.  His diverse musical stylings and activism are reflective of his ethnic background, sharing African-American and Cherokee ancestry from his father, and Russian-Lithuanian Jewish roots from his mother.   Among his musical influences, he cites growing up around his grandparents' music store, The Folk Music Center and Museum, which was supported by regular patrons like Leonard Cohen and Taj Mahal, and watching a live performance by Bob Marley and Peter Tosh at the age of 9.  He began playing guitar around age 9 and took up the slide guitar in his teen years, mimicking the style of Robert Johnson.  Harper played his first gig at age 12, and got his first big break with an invitation to tour with Taj Mahal in 1992, at the age of 23.  Shortly after, he released a limited edition record with seasoned musician Tom Freund, which helped Harper secure a lifetime record deal with Virgin Records.  He released his debut album, Welcome to the Cruel World, two years later at the age of 25.</P><br>
